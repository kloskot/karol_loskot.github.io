                                    yoga and most passionately basketball and rollerskating. These activities have taught me a lot about self discipline and how a strong, positive work ethic and attitude allows you to excel at your passions. </li>

This has shown me the power of collaboration and how people with different talents come together they can create something incredible. Now I have picked up the drums and am hoping to master them better than the clarinet.</li>

For my product I designed and created a works-like and looks-like prototype of a health monitoring dog collar inspired by FitBit which would record and display roughly the amount of callories the dog has burnt and the amount of steps it took through the use of an accelerometer and gyroscope.</li>
                            <li><span>Imperial Gold Crest Award (2019)</span><br>A group reaserch project on a randomly assigned field which later was presented at Imperial collage. Me and my team where assigned the field of biomechanics from which we wrote the paper titled: "The biomechanics of Computer gaming". To conduct our research we had frequent meeting with our mentor who was a PHD student of biomechanics and used observation through labeling and recording the movment of differnt hand joins affected by the ergonomics of the mouse as well as the style of grip.</li>
