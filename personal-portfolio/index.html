                        any opportunity that will broaden my set
                        of skills. I accept any challenge with open
                        arms and tackle it utilizing both strong
                        individual skills and teamwork. I approach
                        any problem with both logic and creativity.
                        Having the amazing opportunity to attend the University of Nottingham has allowed to explore multiple areas of computer science from VR game development to robotics,
                        and develop many amazing projects in a group, paired and individual setting. </p>

It would be a dream come true to incorporate this passion with my profession which has inspired me to work on an independent project that aids
                                    in building and connecting the local basketball community.</li>

I've been playing clarinet for around 3 years now on and off however every time I pick it up I find myself enjoying it and can never seem to fully let go of it. This passion has given me the privilege to play alongside my borough orchestra during my earlier days of playing the clarinet. </li>
